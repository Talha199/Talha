        Hallo! Mein Name ist <b>Talha</b> und das ist meine Website,<br>
        Ich bin <b>14</b> Jahre alt. Meine Hobbys sind <b>Videospiele spielen</b><br>
        und <b>Filme schauen.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Ich weiß nicht mehr was ich hier schreiben soll <br>
        weil ich nichts mehr zu erzählen habe <br>
        Das mach ich nur damit das Website gut aussieht
        <br>
        <br>
        It had been a late night. To be more correct,<br>
        it had been an early morning. It was now 3:00 AM and <br>
        George was just getting home. <br>
        He wasn't sure if it had been worth it. <br>
        He was supposed to have been finished by 10:00 PM, <br>
        but his boss had implored him to stay <br>
        and help when it was clear they weren't going to meet the 10:00 PM target time. <br>
        So, he had stayed an extra 5 hours and lost a good night's sleep for something he didn't really believe in, <br>
        but he did anyway because he was afraid if he refused he might lose his job.
